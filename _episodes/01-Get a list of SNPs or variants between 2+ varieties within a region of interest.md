## Find genotypic data for your reference germplasm
Enter the name of each germplasm you are interested in by typing it in the textfield labelled germplasm, `ILL 8006` and `CDC Milestone` in this example. Make sure the correct species is selected to the right of the textbox. To add more then one germplasm, click the `green +` button.

After entering `ILL 8006` in the top germplasm textfield, you will notice that it autocompleted as you type. Then click the `green +` button and enter `CDC Milestone` in the second textfield which appears.
Each time you click the `green +` button or `search`, the genotypic data for the listed germplasm will be shown.
