## Step #1: Go to the Lentil Genotype Matrix Tool
When you land on the Knowpulse home page, click on "Genotypes" at the top of the page, this will scroll you down to the genotypes section. Then you want to click on "Lentil Genotypes" to access the Lentil Genotype Matrix Tool.

## Step #2: Find genotypic data for your reference germplasm
Enter the name of each germplasm you are interested in, `ILL 8006` and `CDC Milestone` in this case,  by typing it in the textfield labelled germplasm. Then check the correct species is selected to the right of the textbox. To add more then one germplasm click the green + button.

Enter "ILL 8006" in the top germplasm textfield. You will notice that it autocompleted as you type. Then click the green + button and enter "CDC Milestone" in the second textfield which appears.
Each time you click the green + button or search, the genotypic data for the listed germplasm will be shown.

## Step #3: Restrict the Sequence Variants to polymorphic between your germplasm
Underneath germplasm, there is a filter to restrict to polymorphic variants. This filter compares two germplasm and only shows variants with different genotypic calls.

For our example, we would select `ILL 8006` in the first drop down and `CDC Milestone` in the second drop-down to see only sequence variants with differing genotypes (i.e polymorphic variants) between these two germplasm.
Click Search to see the results.
